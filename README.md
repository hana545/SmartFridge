# SmartFridge

A mobile app made with Android Studio in Java, using Firebase (database, and authentification) and Google Cloud Platform (geofencing)

This app helps users to track which groceries they have in their fridge and when they expire. Users can see informations about groceries such as quantity and expiration date. This app provides leaving messages on the "fridge", searching recipes based on current groceries in the fridge and creating shopping list. Also, there are notifications for posting a new message and for buying new groceries when the user passes by a grocery store.
